  "description": "This software analyzes resting-state fMRI data to examine how menstrual cycle phases modulate brain network dynamics in naturally-cycling women. It quantifies dynamical complexity across early follicular, pre-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases, revealing increased variability during the pre-ovulatory phase. The tool also models hormone (estradiol, progesterone) and age-related effects on large-scale functional networks, providing insights into the neuroendocrine modulation of brain connectivity across the menstrual cycle.",
